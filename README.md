# Rust Introduction

A collection of beginner Rust projects to learn the fundamentals of the language.

## Projects

### 1. hello_world
A simple "Hello, World!" program - the traditional first program in any language.

**Run:**
```bash
cd hello_world
rustc main.rs
./main
```

### 2. hello_cargo
An introduction to Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system. This project demonstrates basic input/output operations.

**Run:**
```bash
cd hello_cargo
cargo run
```

### 3. guessing_game
A complete number guessing game that demonstrates:
- User input/output
- Random number generation
- Pattern matching
- Error handling
- Loops and control flow

**Run:**
```bash
cd guessing_game
cargo run
```

The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100, and you'll need to guess it!
